Midway through her second year at NUS as a Psychology major, Deryn has her eyes on the abnormal, social and developmental sides of the field. She is keen to gain a better understanding of the underlying determinants of stress and disorder, from common factors like anxiety to even issues in dermatology, as well as contribute to our handle on therapeutic interventions. In the future, she hopes to work in areas to do with social processes or children.
