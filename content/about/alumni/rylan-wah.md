Rylan is currently a Year 2 Psychology major also minoring in Economics. His general topics of interest include social and clinical psychology especially in the context of Singapore where mental health awareness is on the rise for some conditions such as anxiety but not so much so in others. Hence, he would like to pursue a master's in clinical psychology for his postgraduate studies to further contribute in the field of psychology in Singapore.
