Dylan is a Psychology undergraduate in his second year, with a second Major in Life Sciences. He has a strong interest in the inner workings of the human mind and behaviour, as well as the interactions between the organisms within the ecosystem, as well as the ecosystem itself, which the Life Sciences emphasise and tie into Psychology. Currently, he aims to complete his Bachelor's in said areas after completion of the research in the lab.
