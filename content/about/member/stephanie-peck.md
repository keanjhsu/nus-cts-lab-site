Stephanie is a 2nd Year Psychology Major with a Double Minor in English Literature and Southeast Asian Studies. She is interested in mental health, education and the literary arts. She has too many books on her to-read list but that won't stop her from buying more books. She hopes to pursue clinical studies or counselling after graduation.
