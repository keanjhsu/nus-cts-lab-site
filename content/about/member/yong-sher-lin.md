Sher Lin is currently a student majoring in Psychology, and she deeply fascinated by the complex interplay between cognition and mental health conditions. She is broadly interested in research that explores the cognitive underpinnings of mental disorders and the potential for cognitive-based interventions.

Looking forward, Sher Lin plans to pursue a career in Clinical Psychology or a related field, focusing on innovative therapeutic approaches to treat mental health conditions and improve patient outcomes. Currently, she hopes to work with adult and/or child populations. She is also considering further education in a graduate program in applied clinical research to continue exploring these vital connections.
